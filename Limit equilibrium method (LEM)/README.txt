This collection of files provides a Python implementation of the three-dimensional simplified Janbu calculation theory within the limit equilibrium method. Each folder is designed to be executed independently, allowing the completion of specific steps.

If your objective is to obtain the stability coefficient and the final visualization directly from the traversal calculations, you can follow these steps:

1. Run the code in the F folder to generate the output data table.
2. Import the generated data table into the code in the G folder, and execute it to produce the visualized results.

Additionally, most folders include example output images for testing and reference purposes.
