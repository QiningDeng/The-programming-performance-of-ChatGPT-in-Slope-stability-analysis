Three-dimensional slope stability analysis has been selected as a case study to evaluate ChatGPT's performance in assisting with engineering computation tasks. Two methods for calculating slope stability coefficients, namely the limit equilibrium method and the strength reduction method, are implemented using Python through standardized programming practices. A systematic ChatGPT-assisted programming approach for 3D slope stability analysis is proposed.

The limit equilibrium method is based on the three-dimensional simplified Janbu method. Geometric and mechanical parameters within each potential sliding surface region are calculated iteratively, followed by the computation of stability coefficients for each sliding surface. The minimum stability coefficient is identified through comparison, and the corresponding sliding surface is determined as the potential critical surface.

The strength reduction method is realized through three key components: the computation of finite element basic equations, the strength reduction process, and the establishment of a nonlinear elastic-plastic constitutive model with Newton's iterative solution. The computational logic and theoretical framework of the strength reduction method, with the owner's consent, reference the MATLAB source code available at https://github.com/sysala/SSRM.

Code testing and validation are further aligned with the computational theory described in the following references:

The case study assumes a fixed three-dimensional slope geometry, focusing on the stability analysis of homogeneous soil without considering groundwater effects. Future work will extend the methodology to analyze scenarios involving multi-layered soil, groundwater seepage, seismic effects, and other complex conditions to enhance applicability.
