The function definitions in the Python code snippet within this file are interdependent and nested. To execute the code, please manually download the snippets and call them from Main.py. Ensure that all the code files are stored in the same folder path after downloading.

We extend our gratitude to S. Sysala, E. Hrubešová, Z. Michalec, and F. Tschuchnigg. Without the MATLAB source code they provided for the strength reduction method, implementing the relevant calculation theory in Python would not have been possible.

This folder contains the calculation results of slope stability coefficients under different cohesion forces and internal friction angles. The error data table corresponding to the corresponding violin graph is obtained by the calculation result of commercial software Abaqus2024.
